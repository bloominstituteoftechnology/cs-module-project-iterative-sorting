# We draw N discs on a plane. The discs are numbered from 0 to N − 1. 
# An array A of N non-negative integers, specifying the radiuses of the discs, 
# is given. The J-th disc is drawn with its center at (J, 0) and radius A[J].

# We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J ≠ K and the J-th 
# and K-th discs have at least one common point (assuming that the discs contain 
# their borders).

# The figure below shows discs drawn for N = 6 and A as follows:

#   A[0] = 1
#   A[1] = 5
#   A[2] = 2
#   A[3] = 1
#   A[4] = 4
#   A[5] = 0


# There are eleven (unordered) pairs of discs that intersect, namely:

# discs 1 and 4 intersect, and both intersect with all the other discs;
# disc 2 also intersects with discs 0 and 3.
# Write a function:

# def solution(A)

# that, given an array A describing N discs as explained above, returns the number of (unordered) pairs of intersecting discs. The function should return −1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000.

# Given array A shown above, the function should return 11, as explained above.

# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..2,147,483,647].
