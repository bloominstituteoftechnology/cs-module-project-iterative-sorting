# A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.

# The leader of this array is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.

# An equi leader is an index S such that 0 ≤ S < N − 1 and two sequences A[0], A[1], ..., A[S] and A[S + 1], A[S + 2], ..., A[N − 1] have leaders of the same value.

# For example, given array A such that:

#     A[0] = 4
#     A[1] = 3
#     A[2] = 4
#     A[3] = 4
#     A[4] = 4
#     A[5] = 2
# we can find two equi leaders:

# 0, because sequences: (4) and (3, 4, 4, 4, 2) have the same leader, whose value is 4.
# 2, because sequences: (4, 3, 4) and (4, 4, 2) have the same leader, whose value is 4.
# The goal is to count the number of equi leaders.

# Write a function:

# def solution(A)

# that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of equi leaders.

# For example, given:

#     A[0] = 4
#     A[1] = 3
#     A[2] = 4
#     A[3] = 4
#     A[4] = 4
#     A[5] = 2
# the function should return 2, as explained above.

# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000].

#find the leader, by sorting array and finding middle element
#take original array and
